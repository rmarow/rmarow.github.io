title: "Robyn Marowitz Personal Website"
---

This page is basically a place for all my things. Mostly for me to keep track of, but for anyone to enjoy.

I will be posting favorite recipes/cooking and baking advice as well as my tie dye projects and knitting/crochet projects.
I am newly interested in bird watching and while I record my journey on [ebird](https://ebird.org/profile/NDc4OTk3NA).

If you want to read my book reviews those are on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114119858-robyn-marowitz).
