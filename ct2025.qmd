## ATLS 5410 IDC1: Independent Design Challenge 1  
### Solving a Personal Pet Peeve  

#### **Idea 1: Approach Indicator Light**  
**Pet Peeve:** Interruptions when focused. I work from home a few days a week and my desk is in the common area of the apartment but faces the wall and I get very frustrated if my boyfriend approaches while I am in a focused flow state. Sometimes it is also hard for him to tell if I am on a call or not, but as I am usually on camera I'm not easily able to tell him that. 

**Solution:**  
A **smart light** that detects when my boyfriend is near and displays a status message based on my availability - kind of like an "On Air" sign at a recording studio. The system could use a **proximity sensor** to detect his presence and display one of the following messages:  
- ðŸŸ¥ **"On a call"**   
- ðŸŸ¨ **"Focusing"**  
- ðŸŸ© **"Say Hey"**  

**Possible Components:**  
- **Ultrasonic sensor / RFID module** (for detection)  
- **LED strip or LCD screen** (to display the message)  
- **Button or voice control** (to manually change status)  
- **Arduino** (microcontroller for processing)  

#### **Idea 2: Meal Decider**  
**Pet Peeve:** Struggling to decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. 

**Solution:**  
A physical meal suggestion device that helps pick a meal based on my input and sends a recipe from a list of pre-selected options to my phone via bluetooth. I want te options to be pre-selected since I have some allergies/dietary restrictions and want them to be things I would actuallty want to make. 

**How it Works:**  
1. **Press a button or turn a dial** to generate a random meal suggestion.  
2. The **LCD screen or LED display** shows the meal idea (e.g., "Tacos!" or "Stir Fry").  
3. **Bluetooth sends a recipe link** to my phone for the selected meal.  
4. (Optional) A second button allows for a **re-roll** if I donâ€™t like the first option.  

**Possible Components:**  
- **Push button or rotary dial** (to select a meal).  
- **LCD screen or LED matrix** (to display meal suggestions).  
- **HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth module** (to send recipe links to my phone).  
- **Arduino** (to handle meal selection, display, and Bluetooth connection).  
- **Pre-set meal list** with corresponding recipe URLs.  

**Challenges & Considerations:**  
- Ensuring **Bluetooth pairing** is smooth and simple.  
- How to encorporate a pre-set list of meal ideas and recipe links.
