## ATLS 5410 IDC1: Independent Design Challenge 1  
### Solving a Personal Pet Peeve  

#### **Idea 1: "Approach Indicator Light"**  
**Pet Peeve:** Interruptions when focused. I work from home a few days a week and my desk is in the common area of the apartment but faces the wall and I get very frustrated if my boyfriend approaches while I am in a focused flow state. Sometimes it is also hard for him to tell if I am on a call or not, but as I am usually on camera I'm not easily able to tell him that. 

**Solution:**  
A **smart light** that detects when my boyfriend is near and displays a status message based on my availability - kind of like an "On Air" sign at a recording studio. The system could use a **proximity sensor** to detect his presence and display one of the following messages:  
- ðŸŸ¥ **"On a call"**   
- ðŸŸ¨ **"Focusing"**  
- ðŸŸ© **"Say Hey"**  

**Possible Components:**  
- **Ultrasonic sensor / RFID module** (for detection)  
- **LED strip or LCD screen** (to display the message)  
- **Button or voice control** (to manually change status)  
- **Arduino** (microcontroller for processing)  

**Challenges & Considerations:**  
- Ensuring accurate detection of my partner.  
- Implementing a user-friendly way to change statuses manually.
